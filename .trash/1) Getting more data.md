Can you get more training data?

The quality of your models is generally constrained by the quality of your training data. You want the best data you can get for your problem.

You also want lots of it.

Deep learning and other modern nonlinear machine learning techniques get better with more data. Deep learning especially. It is one of the main points that make deep learning so exciting.

Take a look at theÂ following cartoon:

More data does not always help, but it can. If I am given the choice, I will get more data for the optionality it provides.
