In very simple terms, mathematical optimization is a process of finding the best possible solution from a set of available options. This process involves minimizing or maximizing real functions (that is, equations that can have both positive and negative values) by selecting the input values (the variables in the equation) that will produce the best results. This process can be used in many different areas of mathematics, and it can be used to solve problems that have more than one objective.
