Fitting a model means that you're making your algorithm learn the relationship (a.k.a finding patterns) between predictors(features, labels) and outcome(target) so that you can predict the future values of the outcome.  

So the best fitted model has a specific set of [[What are parameters|parameters]] which best defines the problem at hand.

**Fitting** refers to <mark style="background: lightblue; color: black !important; font-weight: 300">adjusting the parameters in the model to improve accuracy. The process involves running an algorithm on data for which the target variable (“labeled” data) is known to produce a machine learning model.</mark> Then, the model’s outcomes are compared to the real, observed values of the target variable to determine the accuracy.
```

The next step involves adjusting the algorithm’s standard parameters in order to reduce the level of error and make the model more accurate when determining the relationship between the features and the target variable. This process is repeated several times until the model finds the optimal parameters to make predictions with substantial accuracy.
