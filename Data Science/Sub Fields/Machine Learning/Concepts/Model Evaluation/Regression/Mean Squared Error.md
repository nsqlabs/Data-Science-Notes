**Mean squared error (MSE)** takes the mean squared difference between the target and predicted values. This value is widely used for many regression problems and larger errors have correspondingly larger squared contributions to the mean error. 

MSE is given by the following formula:

$$
\text {MAE (Mean Squared Error)} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1} ^ N (y_i - \hat{y})^2
$$

where $y_i$ represents the predicted value of $ŷ_i$:
