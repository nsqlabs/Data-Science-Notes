Regression is a method for understanding the relationship between **independent variables or features** and a **dependent variable or outcome**.  Regression — as fancy as it sounds **can be thought of as “relationship” between any two things.** 

```ad-hint
For example, imagine you stay on the ground and the temperature is 70°F. You start climbing a hill and as you climb, you realize that you are feeling colder and the temperature is dropping. When you reach the hilltop which is 500 meters above ground level and you measure the temperature is 60°F. **We can conclude that the height above sea level influences temperature. Hence, there is a relationship between height and temperature. This is termed “regression” in statistics. The temperature depends on height and hence is the “dependent” variable, whereas height is the “independent” variable. There may be various factors influencing the temperature such as humidity, pressure, even air pollution levels etc. All such factors have a relationship with the temperature which can be written mathematically as an equation.**
