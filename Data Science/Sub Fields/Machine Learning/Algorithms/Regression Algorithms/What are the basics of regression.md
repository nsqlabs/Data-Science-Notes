Outcomes can then be predicted once the relationship between independent and dependent variables has been estimated. 
Regression is a field of study in statistics which forms a key part of forecast models in machine learning. Itâ€™s used as an approach to predict continuous outcomes in predictive modelling, so has utility in forecasting and predicting outcomes from data.
