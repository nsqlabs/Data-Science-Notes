For complex connections between data, the relationship might be explained by more than one variable. In this case, an analyst uses multiple regression which attempts to explain a dependent variable using more than one independent variable.

There are two main uses for multiple regression analysis. The first is to determine the dependent variable based on multiple independent variables. For example, you may be interested in determining what a crop yield will be based on temperature, rainfall, and other independent variables. The second is to determine how strong the relationship is between each variable. For example, you may be interested in knowing how a crop yield will change if rainfall increases or the temperature decreases.

Multiple regression assumes there is not a strong relationship between each independent variable. It also assumes there is a correlation between each independent variable and the single dependent variable. Each of these relationships is weighted to ensure more impactful independent variables drive the dependent value by adding a unique regression coefficient to each independent variable.

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1*x_1 + \beta_1*x_1 + \beta_1*x_1 + ... + \beta_n*x_n 
$$

- $\beta_0$ is $y$ intercept
- $\beta_1$ to $\beta_n$ are slopes with respect to feature $X_i$

## Is Multiple Linear Regression Better Than Simple Linear Regression?

Multiple linear regression is a more specific calculation than simple linear regression. For straight-forward relationships, simple linear regression may easily capture the relationship between the two variables. For more complex relationships requiring more consideration, multiple linear regression is often better.

## When Should You Use Multiple Linear Regression?

Multiple linear regression should be used when multiple independent variables determine the outcome of a single dependent variable. This is often the case when forecasting more complex relationships.

## How Do You Interpret Multiple Regression?

A multiple regression formula has multiple slopes (one for each variable) and one y-intercept. It is interpreted the same as a simple linear regression formula except there are multiple variables that all impact the slope of the relationship.
