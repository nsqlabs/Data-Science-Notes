Note that linear regression is the simplest form of regression there is (Making it a good starting point!). There are two characteristics that make it the simplest form of regression.

1. First, **it’s only capable of capturing linear relationships.** If there’s an exponential trend in your data, better not use it. Logarithmic? Nope, not that either. There are ways to massage the data to use linear regression on those data sets, but it can’t be done straight away.
2. Secondly, **it’s only capable of handling relationships between two variables.** If you have more variables than that in your data set, you need to start looking into multiple regression instead. That said, since linear regression is the simplest form of regression it’s a good starting point.
