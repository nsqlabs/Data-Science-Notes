- When it comes time to make a prediction, the [[Random Forests simply explained|random forest]] takes an average of all the individual decision tree estimates. (This is the case for a regression task, such as our problem where we are predicting a continuous value of temperature.

- The other class of problems is known as classification, where the targets are a discrete class label such as cloudy or sunny. In that case, the random forest will take a **[[Taking advantage of the crowd wisdom|majority]] vote** for the predicted class). With that in mind, we now have down all the conceptual parts of the random forest!
