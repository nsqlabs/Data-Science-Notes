You need to clearly spell out what constitutes good and bad performance.

This maybe as accuracy or false positives or whatever metrics are important to the business.

Spell out, and use the current model you have developed as the baseline numbers.

These numbers may be increased over time as you improve the system.

> [!caution] Performance requires are important. Without them, you will not be able to setup the tests you will need to determine if the system is behaving as expected.

Do not proceed until you have agreed upon minimum, mean or a performance range expectation.
