> [!important] Not all predictive models are at Google-scale.

Sometimes you develop a small predictive model that you want to put in your software.

## I Have a Model. Now What?

So you have been through a systematic process and created a reliable and accurate model that can make predictions for your problem.

You want to use this model somehow.

-   **Maybe you want to create a standalone program that can make ad hoc predictions.**
-   **Maybe you want to incorporate the model into your existing software.**

Let’s assume that your software is modest. You are not looking for Google-sized scale deployment. Maybe it’s just for you, maybe just a client or maybe for a few workstations.
