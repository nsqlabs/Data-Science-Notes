Once you have discovered a good model and a good enough result (or not, as the case may be), you will want to summarize what was learned and present it to stakeholders. This may be yourself, a client or the company for which you work.

Use a powerpoint template and address the sections listed below. You might like to write up a one-pager and use part section as a section header. Try to follow this process even on small experimental projects you do for yourself such as tutorials and competitions. It is easy to spend an inordinate number of hours on a project and you want to make sure to capture all the great things you learn along the way.

Below are the sections you can complete when reporting the results for a project.

-   **Context** (Why): Define the environment in which the problem exists and set up the motivation for **the** research question.
-   **Problem** (Question): Concisely describe the problem as a question that you went out and answered.
-   **Solution** (Answer): Concisely describe the solution as an answer to the question you posed in the previous section. Be specific.
-   **Findings**: Bulleted lists of discoveries you made along the way that interest the audience. They may be discoveries in the data, methods that did or did not work or the model performance benefits you achieved along your journey.
-   **Limitations**: Consider where the model does not work or questions that the model does not answer. Do not shy away from these questions, defining where the model excels is more trusted if you can define where it does not excel.
-   **Conclusions** (Why+Question+Answer): Revisit the why, research question and the answer you discovered in a tight little package that is easy to remember and repeat for yourself and others.

The type of audience you are presenting to will define the amount of detail you go into. Having the discipline to complete your projects with a report on results, even on small side projects will accelerate your learning in field. On such small side projects, I highly recommend sharing results of side projects on blogs or with communities and elicit feedback that you can capture and take with you into the start of your next project.
