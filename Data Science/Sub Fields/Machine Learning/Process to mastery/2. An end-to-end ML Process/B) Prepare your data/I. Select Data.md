This step is concerned with selecting the subset of all available data that you will be working with. 

```ad-hint
There is always a strong desire for including all data that is available, that the maxim “more is better” will hold. This may or may not be true.
```

**You need to consider what data you actually need to address the question or problem you are working on**. Make some assumptions about the data you require and <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">be careful to record those assumptions so that you can test them later if needed.</mark> 

Below are some questions to help you think through this process:

-  <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> What is the extent of the data you have available?</mark> For example through time, database tables, connected systems. Ensure you have a clear picture of everything that you can use.
-  <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> What data is not available that you wish you had available?</mark> For example data that is not recorded or cannot be recorded. You may be able to derive or simulate this data.
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">What data don’t you need to address the problem?</mark> Excluding data is almost always easier than including data. Note down which data you excluded and why.

```ad-warning
It is only in small problems, like competition or toy datasets where the data has already been selected for you.
