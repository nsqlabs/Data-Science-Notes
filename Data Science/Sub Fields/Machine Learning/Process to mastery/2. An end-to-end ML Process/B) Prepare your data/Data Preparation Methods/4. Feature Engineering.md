Feature engineering refers to the process of **creating new input variables from the available data.**

==Engineering new features is highly specific to your data and data types. As such, it often requires the collaboration of a subject matter expert to help identify new features that could be constructed from the data.==

This specialization makes it a challenging topic to generalize to general methods.

Nevertheless, there are some techniques that can be reused, such as:

-   **Adding a boolean flag variable for some state.**
-   **Adding a group or global summary statistic, such as a mean.**
-   **Adding new variables for each component of a compound variable, such as a date-time.**

A popular approach drawn from statistics is to **create copies of numerical input variables that have been changed with a simple mathematical operation, such as raising them to a power or multiplied with other input variables, referred to as polynomial features.**

-   **Polynomial Transform**: Create copies of numerical input variables that are raised to a power.

The theme of feature engineering is to add broader context to a single observation or decompose a complex variable, both in an effort to provide a more straightforward perspective on the input data.

I like to think of feature engineering as a type of data transform, although it would be just as reasonable to think of data transforms as a type of feature engineering.
