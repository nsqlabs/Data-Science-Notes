We can define data preparation as **the transformation of raw data into a form that is more suitable for modeling.**

Nevertheless, there are steps in a predictive modeling project before and after the data preparation step that are important and inform the data preparation that is to be performed.

The process of applied machine learning consists of a sequence of steps.

```ad-tip
We may jump back and forth between the steps for any given project, but all projects have the same general steps; they are:

-   **Step 1**: Define Problem.
-   **Step 2**: Prepare Data.
-   **Step 3**: Evaluate Models.
-   **Step 4**: Finalize Model.
```

> **We are concerned with the data preparation step (step 2), and there are common or standard tasks that you may use or explore during the data preparation step in a machine learning project.**

The types of data preparation performed depend on your data, as you might expect.

Nevertheless, as you work through multiple predictive modeling projects, you see and require the same types of data preparation tasks again and again.

These tasks include:

-   **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and correcting mistakes or errors in the data.
-   **Feature Selection**: Identifying those input variables that are most relevant to the task.
-   **Data Transforms**: Changing the scale or distribution of variables.
-   **Feature Engineering**: Deriving new variables from available data.
-   **Dimensionality Reduction**: Creating compact projections of the data.
