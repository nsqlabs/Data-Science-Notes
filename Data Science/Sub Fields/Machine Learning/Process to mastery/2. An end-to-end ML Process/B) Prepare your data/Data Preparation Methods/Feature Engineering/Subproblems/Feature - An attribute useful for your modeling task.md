> Tabular data is described in terms of observations or instances (rows) that are made up of variables or attributes (columns). An attribute could be a feature.

The idea of a feature, separate from an attribute, makes more sense in the context of a problem. **A feature is an attribute that is useful or meaningful to your problem. It is an important part of an observation for learning about the structure of the problem that is being modeled.**

**<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">I use “_meaningful_” to discriminate attributes from features. Some might not. I think there is no such thing as a non-meaningful feature. If a feature has no impact on the problem, it is not part of the problem.</mark> **

```ad-example
In computer vision, an image is an observation, but a feature could be a line in the image. In natural language processing, a document or a tweet could be an observation, and a phrase or word count could be a feature. In speech recognition, an utterance could be an observation, but a feature might be a single word or phoneme.
