When your goal is to get the best possible results from aÂ predictive model, you need to get the most from what you have.

This includes getting the best results from the algorithms you are using. It also involves getting the most out of the data for your algorithms to work with.

## **How do you get the most out of your data for predictive modeling?**

This is the problem that the process and practice of feature engineering solves.

Actually the success of all Machine Learning algorithms depends on how you present the data.
