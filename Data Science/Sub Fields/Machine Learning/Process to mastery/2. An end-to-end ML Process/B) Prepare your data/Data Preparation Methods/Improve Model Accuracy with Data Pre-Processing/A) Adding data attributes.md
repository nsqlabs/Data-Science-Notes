Advanced models can extract the relationships from complex attributes, although some models require those relationships to be spelled out plainly. Deriving new attributes from your training data to include in the modeling process can give you a boost in model performance.

-   **Dummy Attributes**: **Categorical attributes can be converted into n-binary attributes, where n is the number of categories (or levels) that the attribute has.** These denormalized or decomposed attributes are known as dummy attributes or dummy variables.
-   **Transformed Attribute**: A transformed variation of **an attribute can be added to the dataset in order to allow a linear method to exploit possible linear and non-linear relationships between attributes. Simple transforms like log, square and square root can be used.**
-   **Missing Data**: Attributes with missing data can have that **missing data imputed using a reliable method, such as k-nearest neighbors.**
