You must pre-process your raw data before you model your problem. The specific preparation may depend on the data that you have available and the machine learning algorithms you want to use.

Sometimes, pre-processing of data can lead to unexpected improvements in model accuracy. This may be because a relationship in the data has been simplified or unobscured.

[Data preparation](https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-prepare-data-for-machine-learning/ "How to Prepare Data For Machine Learning")Â is an important step and you should experiment with data pre-processing steps that are appropriate for your data to see if you can get that desirable boost in model accuracy.

There are three types of pre-processing you can consider for your data:

-   Add attributes to your data
-   Remove attributes from your data
-   Transform attributes in your data
