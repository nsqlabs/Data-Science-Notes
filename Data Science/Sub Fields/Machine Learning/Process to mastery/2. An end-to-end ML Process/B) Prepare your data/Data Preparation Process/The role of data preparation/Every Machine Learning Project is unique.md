Each machine learning project is different because the specific data at the core of the project is different.

You may be the first person (ever!) to work on the specific predictive modeling problem. That does not mean that others have not worked on similar prediction tasks or perhaps even the same high-level task, but you are the first to use the specific data that you have collected (unless you are using a standard dataset for practice).

```ad-quote
"*… the right features can only be defined in the context of both the model and the data; since data and models are so diverse, it’s difficult to generalize the practice of feature engineering across projects.*"
```

This makes each machine learning project unique. No one can tell you what the best results are or might be, or what algorithms to use to achieve them. You must establish a baseline in performance as a point of reference to compare all of your models and you must discover what algorithm works best for your specific dataset.

You are not alone, and the vast literature on applied machine learning that has come before can inform you as to techniques to use to robustly evaluate your model and algorithms to evaluate.

Even though your project is unique, the steps on the path to a good or even the best result are generally the same from project to project. This is sometimes referred to as the “_applied machine learning process_“, “_data science process_“, or the older name “_knowledge discovery in databases_” (KDD).
