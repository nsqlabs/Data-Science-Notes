In this third and final step of the problem definition, explore how you would solve the problem manually.

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">List out step-by-step what data you would collect, how you would prepare it and how you would design a program to solve the problem. This may include prototypes and experiments you would need to perform which are a gold mine because they will highlight questions and uncertainties you have about the domain that could be explored.</mark> 

This is **a powerful tool. It can highlight problems that actually can be solved satisfactorily using a manually implemented solution. It also flushes out important domain knowledge that has been trapped up until now like where the data is actually stored, what types of features would be useful and many other details.**

```ad-tip
Collect all of these details as they occur to you and update the previous sections of the problem definition. Especially the assumptions and rules of thumb.
