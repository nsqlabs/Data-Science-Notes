The step before data preparation involves defining the problem.

As part of defining the problem, this may involve many sub-tasks, such as:

-   Gather data from the problem domain.
-   Discuss the project with subject matter experts.
-   Select those variables to be used as inputs and outputs for a predictive model.
-   Review the data that has been collected.
-   Summarize the collected data using statistical methods.
-   Visualize the collected data using plots and charts.

Information known about the data can be used in selecting and configuring data preparation methods.

For example, plots of the data may help identify whether a variable has outlier values. This can help in data cleaning operations. It may also provide insight into the probability distribution that underlies the data. This may help in determining whether data transforms that change a variableâ€™s probability distribution would be appropriate.

Statistical methods, such as descriptive statistics, can be used to determine whether scaling operations might be required. Statistical hypothesis tests can be used to determine whether a variable matches a given probability distribution.

Pairwise plots and statistics can be used to determine whether variables are related, and if so, how much, providing insight into whether one or more variables are redundant or irrelevant to the target variable.
