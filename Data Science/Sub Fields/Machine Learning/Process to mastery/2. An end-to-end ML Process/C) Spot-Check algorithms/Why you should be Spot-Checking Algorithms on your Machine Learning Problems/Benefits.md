There are 3 key benefits of spot-checking algorithms on your machine learning problems:

-   **Speed**: ==You could spend a lot of time playing around with different algorithms, tuning parameters and thinking about what algorithms will do well on your problem.  A single spot-check experiment can save hours, days and even weeks of noodling around.==
-   **Objective**: ==There is a tendency to go with what has worked for you before. We pick our favorite algorithm (or algorithms) and apply them to every problem we see. The power of machine learning is that there are so many different ways to approach a given problem. A spot-check experiment allows you to automatically and objectively discover those algorithms that are the best at picking out the structure in the problem so you can focus your attention.==
-   **Results**: ==Spot-checking algorithms gets you usable results, fast. You may discover a good enough solution in the first spot experiment. Alternatively, you may quickly learn that your dataset does not expose enough structure for any mainstream algorithm to do well.== Spot-checking gives you the results you need to decide whether to move forward and optimize a given model or backward and revisit the presentation of the problem.
