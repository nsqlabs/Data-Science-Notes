There is no best machine learning algorithm or algorithm parameters.

-   _Which is the best machine learning algorithm?_
-   _What is the mapping between machine learning algorithms and problems?_
-   _What are the best parameters for a machine learning algorithm?_

There is a pattern to these questions.

> [!caution] You generally do not and cannot know the answers to these questions beforehand. You must discover it through empirical study.

There are some **broad brush heuristics to answer these questions, but even these can trip you up if you are looking to get the most from an algorithm or a problem.**
