> [!summary] **Some algorithms have more “_power_” than others.
> 
> They are non-parametric or highly flexible and adaptive, or highly self-tuning or all of the above.
>  **<mark style="background: blue">Typically this power comes at a cost of difficulty to implement, the need for very large datasets, limited scalability, or a large number of coefficients that may result in over-fitting.</mark>**

With bigger datasets, **there has been a renewed interest in simpler methods that scale and perform well.**

Which is the best algorithm, the algorithm that you should always try and spend the most time learning?

> [!attention] I could throw out some names, but the smartest answer is “_none_” and “_all_“.
