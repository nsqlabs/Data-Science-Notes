You get good results, fast.

If random forest is your favorite algorithm, you could spend days or weeks trying in vain to get the most from the algorithm on your problem, which may not be suited to the method in the first place. 

> [!seealso] With a data-driven methodology, you can discount (relative) poor performers early. You can fail fast.

The result is that you no longer care about algorithm hype, it’s just another method to include in your spot checking suite. You no longer fret over whether you’re missing out by not using algorithm _X_ or _Y_ or configuration _A_ or _B_ (fear of loss), you throw them in the mix.

> [!warning] It takes discipline to not fall back on biases and favorite algorithms and configurations. It’s hard work to get good and robust results.
