There are general classes of problems, say supervised problems like classification and regression and unsupervised problems like manifold learning and clustering.

There are more specific instances of these problems in sub-fields of machine learning like Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and Speech Processing. We can also go the other way, more abstract and consider all of these problems as instances of function approximation and function optimization.

You can map algorithms to classes of problems, for example, there are algorithms that can handle supervised regression problems and supervised classification problems, and both types of problems.

You can also construct [catalogs of algorithms](https://machinelearningmastery.com/a-tour-of-machine-learning-algorithms/ "A Tour of Machine Learning Algorithms"), and that may be useful to inspire you as to which algorithms to try.

You can race algorithms on a problem and report the results. Sometimes this is called a bake-off and is popular in some conference proceedings for presenting new algorithms.
