The data-driven approach is a problem of search. You can leverage automation.

> - You can write re-usable scripts to search the for the most reliable test harness for your problem before you begin. No more ad hoc guessing.

The line between different algorithms is gone. A new parameter configuration is a new algorithm. **You can write re-usable scripts to grid or random search each algorithm to truly sample its capability.**

Add feature engineering on the front so that each “_view_” on the data is a new problem for algorithms to be challenged against. Bolt-on ensembles at the end to combine some or all results (meta-algorithms).
