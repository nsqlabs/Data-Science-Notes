Generally, racing algorithms is [anti-intellectual](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.73.6198). It is rarely scientifically rigorous (apples to apples).

> [!danger] EACH PROBLEM IS UNIQUE
> A key problem with racing algorithms is that you cannot easily transfer the findings from one problem to another.

If algorithm _A_ kills algorithm _B_ on Problem _X_, what does that tell you about algorithm _A_ and _B_ on problem _Y_? You have to work to relate problems _X_ and _Y_. Do they have the same or similar properties (attributes, attribute distributions, functional form) that are exploited by the algorithms under study? That’s some hard work.

We do not have fine-grained understandings of when one machine learning algorithm works better than another.
