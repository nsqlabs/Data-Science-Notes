The performance measure is the way you want to evaluate a solution to the problem. It is the measurement you will make of the predictions made by a trained model on the test dataset.

Performance measures are typically specialized to the class of problem you are working with, for example classification, regression, and clustering. Many standard performance measures will give you a score that is meaningful to your problem domain. For example, classification accuracy for classification (total correct correction divided by the total predictions made multiple by 100 to turn it into a percentage).

You may also want a more detailed breakdown of performance, for example, you may want to know about the false positives on a spam classification problem because good email will be marked as spam and cannot be read.

There are many standard performance measures to choose from. You rarely have to devise a new performance measure yourself as you can generally find or adapt one that best captures the requirements of the problem being solved. Look to similar problems you uncovered and at the performance measures used to see if any can be adopted.
