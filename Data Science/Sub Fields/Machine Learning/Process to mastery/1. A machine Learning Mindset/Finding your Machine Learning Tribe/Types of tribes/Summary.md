## Business Tribes

Generally, these are people interested in harnessing machine learning effectively in their organization, but not necessarily interested in the nuts and bolts of algorithms or tools.

Business people might use terms like _business intelligence_ or _predictive analytics_, both of which are more general fields that may make use of machine learning techniques

1. [[Business Person with a General Interest]]
2. [[Manager Interested in Delivering a Project]]

## Academic Tribes

Generally, these are people interested in machine learning from an academic perspective. They may be students (undergraduate or postgraduate) or otherwise associated with a university.

Additional examples are post-docs, research associates and lectures of various sorts.

Academic tribes may spend a lot of time researching a specific machine learning algorithm in research papers.

1. [[Machine Learning Student in a Undergraduate or Graduate Class]]
2. [[Machine Learning Researcher Interested in Impacting the Field]]
3. [[General Researcher Interested in Modeling Their Problem]]

## Engineering Tribes

Generally, a group of developers that are used to delivering solutions to problems with software and want to incorporate machine learning.

A good general post I recommend for engineers looking to get into machine learning is “[Machine Learning for Programmers](https://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-for-programmers/)“.

Engineer Tribes can get a lot of help and support in machine learning communities like those on Q&A sites.

1. [[Programmer Interested in Implementing Algorithms]]
2. [[Developer Interested in Delivering One-Off Predictions]]
3. [[Engineer Interested In Developing Smarter Software And Services]]

## Data Tribes

Generally, this are groups of people that primarily are in data roles but may need to make use of machine learning.

1. [[Data Scientist interested in Getting Better Answers to Business Questions]]
2. [[Data Analyst interested in Better Explaining Data]]
