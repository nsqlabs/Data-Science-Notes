A machine learning researcher is interested in a deep understanding of one aspect of machine learning to the point of making a minor addition to extend the field.

A researcher is interested in research papers, journals and the organizations and networking that go along with them.

Textbooks don’t cut it, they’re secondary sources and out of date.

Some high-profile machine learning journals and proceedings are:

-   [Journal of Machine Learning Research](http://www.jmlr.org/) (JMLR)
-   [Neural Information Processing Systems](https://nips.cc/) (NIPS)
-   [Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining](http://www.kdd.org/) (SIGKDD)
-   [International Conference on Machine Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Machine_Learning) (ICML)
