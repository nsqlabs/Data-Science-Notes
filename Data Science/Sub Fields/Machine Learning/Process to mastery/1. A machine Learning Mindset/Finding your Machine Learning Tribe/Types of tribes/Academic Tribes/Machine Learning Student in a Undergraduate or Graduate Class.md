A machineÂ learning student is very likely taking a class and interested in **hyper-specific questions related to techniques and algorithms.**

A student has the **structure to focus and the time to dive deeper into the material. They are best served with a textbook.** Some of the best machine learning textbooks are as follows:

-   [Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective](https://amzn.to/3iFRTWc)
-   [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://amzn.to/2Y1s76G)
-   [The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining. Inference. and Prediction](https://amzn.to/31SA3bt)
