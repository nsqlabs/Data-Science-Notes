A general researcher may be interested in machine learning, but **as a tool. They are most likely interested in building a descriptive or predictive model using their own data.**

For example, a scientist from the field of client research, geology, or biology has their own dataset and is looking to create a model in order to make predictions and/or better understand the underlying problem.

They are often less **interested in model accuracy and more interested in model explainability. Therefore, simpler well understood methods borrowed from statistics are preferred, such as linear regression and logistic regression.**

Nevertheless, good systematic process is desired.
