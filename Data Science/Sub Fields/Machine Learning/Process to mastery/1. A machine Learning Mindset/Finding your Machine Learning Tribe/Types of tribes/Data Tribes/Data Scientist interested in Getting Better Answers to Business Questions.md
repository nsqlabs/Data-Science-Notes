The learning does not stop when you’re a data scientist.

**You must stay on top of the latest data flows, techniques and algorithms. This includes the machine learning techniques that you need to describe data and create predictive models.**

The data scientist can take what they need from the more applied resources listed under “_Engineering Tribes_“, as well as the more theoretical resources listed under “_Academic Tribes_“.

Nevertheless, some data science-centric machine learning resources that include this mix are:

-   [Applied Predictive Modeling](https://amzn.to/3iFPHhq)
-   [An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in R](https://amzn.to/3gYt0V9)
-   [Machine Learning for Hackers](https://amzn.to/3kNsV92)
