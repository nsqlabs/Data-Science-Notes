Data analysts are **primarily interested in explaining data in the context of business interests. Sometimes machine learning algorithms are useful for providing more powerful models.** Mostly descriptive models, but also sometimes predictive.

Like the group “_General Researcher_“, **this group likely has a good foundation in statistics and statistical inference. Also, given that they are most likely interested in a descriptive model, classical methods like linear and logistic regression may be sufficient. Explainability over accuracy in the resulting model.**

Many of the same resources above would be useful, although perhaps with more of a statistical inference stance.
