An excellent way for a programmer to develop skills in machine learning is to use their existing programming skills and implement machine learning algorithms from scratch.

I talk a lot about this approach and give good tips and resources in my blog post “[Understand Machine Learning Algorithms By Implementing Them From Scratch](https://machinelearningmastery.com/understand-machine-learning-algorithms-by-implementing-them-from-scratch/)“.

Three books I recommend for this approach taken from that blog post are:

-   [Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python](https://amzn.to/31R8zmN)
-   [Machine Learning in Action](https://amzn.to/3gTgm9X)
-   [Machine Learning: An Algorithmic Perspective](https://amzn.to/2E7wMwJ)
