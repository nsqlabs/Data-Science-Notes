This may be anyone from an executive to a consultant who has heard about machine learning and is looking to make use of it strategically, perhaps in upcoming projects or initiatives.

This is not really my area, but some resources that might be useful for more strategic thinking include:

-   Gartner’s [Magic Quadrant for Advanced Analytics Platforms](https://www.gartner.com/technology/reprints.do?id=1-2AHPOU0&ct=150225&st=sb), 2015
-   Gartner’s [Machine Learning Drives Digital Business](https://www.gartner.com/doc/2820120/machine-learning-drives-digital-business), 2014
-   McKinsey’s [An executive’s guide to machine learning](http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/high_tech_telecoms_internet/an_executives_guide_to_machine_learning), 2015

I would also recommend the books in the next section for [[Manager Interested in Delivering a Project|"_Managers_“]].
