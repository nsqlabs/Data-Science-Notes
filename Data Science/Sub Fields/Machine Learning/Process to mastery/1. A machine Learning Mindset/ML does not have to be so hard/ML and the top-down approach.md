title: Are you following the status quo of learning ML?

-   Are you taking a bottom-up university course?
-   Are you modeling your learning on such a course?

Or worse:

- **Are you following a top-down type approach but are riddled with guilt, math envy, and insecurities?**
```

To connect the dots for you, I strongly encourage you to study machine learning using the [[Top-Down Learning|top-down]] approach.

-   Don’t start with precursor math.
-   Don’t start with machine learning theory.
-   Don’t code every algorithm from scratch.

```ad-tip
This can all come later to refine and deepen your understanding once you have connections for this abstract knowledge.

# A better framework

1.  Start by learning how to work through very simple predictive modeling problems using a fixed framework with free and easy-to-use open source tools.
2.  Practice on many small projects and slowly increase their complexity.
3.  Show your work by building a public portfolio.

Remember:

-   You learned to read by practicing reading, not by studying language theory.
-   You learned to drive by practicing driving, not by studying combustion engines.
-   You learned to code by practicing coding, not by studying computability theory.

You can learn machine learning by practicing predictive modeling, not by studying math and theory.
