Technical topics like mathematics, physics, and even computer science are taught using a bottom-up approach.

This approach involves laying out the topics in an area of study in a logical way with a natural progression in complexity and capability.

The problem is, humans are not robots executing a learning program. We require motivation, excitement, and most importantly, a connection of the topic to tangible results.

Useful skills we use every day like reading, driving, and programming were not learned this way and were in fact learned using an inverted top-down approach. This **top-down approach** can be used to learn technical subjects directly such as **machine learning**, which can make you a lot more productive a lot sooner, and be a lot of fun.
