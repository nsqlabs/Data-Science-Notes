Take a field of study, such as mathematics.

There is a logical way to lay out the topics in mathematics that build on each other and lead through a natural progression in skills, capability, and understanding.

The problem is, this logical progression might only make sense to those who are already on the other side and can intuit the relationships between the topics.

Most of school is built around this bottom-up natural progression through material. A host of technical and scientific fields of study are taught this way.

Think back to high-school or undergraduate studies and the fundamental fields you may have worked through: examples such as:

-   Mathematics, as mentioned.
-   Biology.
-   Chemistry.
-   Physics.
-   Computer Science.

Think about how the material was laid out, week-by-week, semester-by-semester, year-by-year. Bottom-up, logical progression.

The problem is, the logical progression through the material may not be the best way to learn the material in order to be productive.

We are not robots executing a learning program. We are emotional humans that need motivation, interest, attention, encouragement, and results.

You can learn technical subjects from the bottom-up, and a small percentage of people do prefer things this way, but it is not the only way.
