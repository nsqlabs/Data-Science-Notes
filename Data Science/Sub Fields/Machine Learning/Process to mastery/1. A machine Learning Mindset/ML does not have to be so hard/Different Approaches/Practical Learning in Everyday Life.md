## Learning to Read

Think back; how did you learn to read?

My son is starting to read. Without thinking too much, here are the general techniques he’s using (really the school and us as parents):

-   Start by being read to in order to generate interest and show benefits.
-   Get the alphabet down and making the right sounds.
-   Memorize the most frequent words, their sounds, and how to spell them.
-   Learn the “spell-out-the-word” heuristic to deal with unknown words.
-   Read through books with supervision.
-   Read through books without supervision.

It is important that he continually knows why reading is important, connected to very tangible things he wants to do, like:

-   Read captions on TV shows.
-   Read stories on topics he loves, like Star Wars.
-   Read signs and menus when we are out and about.
-   So on…

It is also important that he gets results that he can track and in which he can see improvement.

-   Larger vocabulary.
-   Smoother reading style
-   Books of increasing complexity.

Here’s how he did not learn to read:

-   Definitions of word types (verbs, nouns, adverbs, etc.)
-   Rules of grammar.
-   Rules of punctuation.
-   Theory of human languages.

## Learning to Drive

Do you drive?

It’s cool if you don’t, but most adults do out of necessity. Society and city design is built around personal mobility.

How did you learn to drive?

I remember some written tests and maybe a test on a computer. I have no memory of studying for them, though I very likely did. Here’s what I do remember.

I remember hiring a driving instructor and doing driving lessons. Every single lesson was practical, in the car, practicing the skill I was required to master, driving the vehicle in traffic.

Here’s what I did not study or discuss with my driving instructor:

-   The history of the automobile.
-   The theory of combustion engines.
-   The common mechanical faults in cars.
-   The electrical system of the car.
-   The theory of traffic flows.

To this day, I still manage to drive safely without any knowledge on these topics.

In fact, I never expect to learn these topics. I have zero need or interest and they will not help me realize the thing I want and need, which is safe and easy personal mobility.

If the car breaks, I’ll call an expert.

## Learning to Code

I started programming without any idea of what coding or software engineering meant.

At home, I messed around with commands in Basic. I messed around with commands in Excel. I modified computer games. And so on. It was fun.

When I started to learn programming and software engineering, it was in university and it was bottom up.

We started with:

-   Language theory
-   Data types
-   Control flow structures
-   Data structures
-   etc.

When we did get to write code, it was on the command line and plagued with compiler problems, path problems, and a whole host of problems unrelated to actually learning programming.

_**I hated programming.**_

Flash-forward a few years. Somehow, I eventually starting working as a professional software engineer on some complex systems that were valued by their users. I was really good at it and I loved it.

Eventually, I did a course that showed how to create graphical user interfaces. And another that showed how to get computers to talk to each other using socket programming. And another on how to get multiple things to run at the same time using threads.

I connected the boring stuff with the thing I really liked: making software that could solve problems, that others could use. I connected it to something that mattered. It was no longer abstract and esoteric.

At least for me, and many developers like me, they taught it wrong. They really did. And it wasted years of time, effort, and results/outcomes that enthusiastic and time-free students like me could dedicate to something they are truly passionate about.
