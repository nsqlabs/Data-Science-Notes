Seriously, I’ve heard “_experts_” say this many times, saying things like:

> You have to know the theory first before you can use this technique, otherwise you cannot use it properly.

I agree that results will be imperfect in the beginning, but improvement and even expertise does not only have to come from theory and fundamentals.

If you believe that a beginner programmer should not be pushing changes to production and deploying them, then surely you must believe that a beginner machine learning practitioner would suffer the same constraints.

Skill must be demonstrated.

Trust must be earned.

This is true regardless of how a skill is acquired.
