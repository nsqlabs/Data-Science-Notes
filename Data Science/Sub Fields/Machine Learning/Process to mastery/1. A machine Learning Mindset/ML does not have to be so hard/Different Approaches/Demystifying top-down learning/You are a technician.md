This is another “_criticism_” I’ve seen leveled at this approach to learning.

**Exactly. We want to be technicians, using the tools in practice to help people and not be researchers..**

**You do not need to cover all of the same ground because you have a different learning objective. Although you can circle back and learn anything you like later once you have a context in which to integrate the abstract knowledge.**
