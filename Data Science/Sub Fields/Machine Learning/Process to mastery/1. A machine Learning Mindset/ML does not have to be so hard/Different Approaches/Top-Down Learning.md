```ad-tip
The bottom-up approach is not just a common way for teaching technical topics; it looks like the only way. At least until you think about how you actually learn.
```

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">The designers of university courses, masters of their subject area, are trying to help. They are laying everything out to give you the logical progression through the material that they think will get you to the skills and capabilities that you require (hopefully).
</mark> 

And as I mentioned, it can work for some people.

It does not work for me, and I expect it does not work for you. In fact, very few programmers I’ve met that are really good at their craft came through computer science programs, or if they did, they learned at home, alone, hacking on side projects.

An alternative is the top-down approach.

> **Flip the conventional approach on its head.**

```ad-hint
Don’t start with definitions and theory. Instead, **start by connecting the subject with the results you want and show how to get results immediately.**

**Lay out a program that focuses on practicing this process of getting results, going deeper into some areas as needed, but always in the context of the result they require.**
```

# Efficient, Effective, and a Fun Way to Learn

The benefits vastly outweigh the challenge of learning this way:

-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">You go straight to the thing you want and start practicing it.</mark> 
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">You have a context for connecting deeper knowledge and even theory.</mark> 
-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">You can efficiently sift and filter topics based on your goals in the subject.</mark> 

It’s faster.

It’s more fun.

And, I bet it makes you much better.

## How could you be better?

<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Because the subject is connected to you emotionally. You have connected it to an outcome or result that matters to you. You are invested. You have demonstrable competence. We all love things we are good at (even if we are a little color blind to how good we are), which drives motivation, enthusiasm, and passion.</mark> 

An enthusiastic learner will blow straight past the fundamentalist.
