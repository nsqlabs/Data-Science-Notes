I think the biggest class of limiting [[Self Limiting Beliefs|belief]] I see is<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> the belief that you cannot get started until you have some specific prior knowledge. The problem is that the prior knowledge you think you need is either not required or is so vast in scope that even experts in that subject don’t know it all.</mark>

title: The case of statistics
For example: “_I need to KNOW statistics_“. See how ambiguous that belief is. How much statistics, what areas of statistics and why do you need to know them before you can start your investigation into machine learning?
```

Below are some of the more common self-limiting beliefs of skills or prior knowledge that must be obtained before you can get started in machine learning.

I can’t get into machine learning until…

-   …I get a degree or higher degree
-   …I complete a course
-   …I am good at linear algebra
-   …I know statistics and probability theory
-   …I have mastered the R programming language

```ad-tip
**You can get started in machine learning today, right now. Run your first classifier in 5 minutes. You’re in.** Now, start blocking out what it is from machine learning that you really want?
