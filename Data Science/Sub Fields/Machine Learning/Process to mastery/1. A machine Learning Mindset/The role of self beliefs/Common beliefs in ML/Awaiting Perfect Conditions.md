Another class of self-limiting belief is where you are waiting for the perfect environment or conditions before taking the leap. Things will never be perfect, leap and make a mess, then leap again.

I can’t get started in machine learning because…

-   …I don’t have the time right now
-   …I don’t have a fast CPU, GPU or a bazillion MB of RAM
-   …I am just a student right now
-   …I am not a good programmer at the moment
-   …I am very busy at work right now

It does take a lot of time and effort to get good at machine learning, but not all at once and not all at the beginning.

You can make good progress with a few hours a week, or tens of minutes per day. There are plenty of [small snack-sized tasks](https://machinelearningmastery.com/self-study-machine-learning-projects/ "4 Self-Study Machine Learning Projects") you could take on to get started in machine learning. You can get started, it is just going to take some sacrifice, like all good things in life.
