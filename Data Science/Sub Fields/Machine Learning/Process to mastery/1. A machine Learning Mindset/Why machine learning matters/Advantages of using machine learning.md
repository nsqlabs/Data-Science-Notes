The field of machine learning <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">provides tools to automatically make decisions from data in order to achieve some goal or requirement. The research questions focus on how to do this better and what the results mean.</mark> 

Let us focus on the practical problem-solving capabilities of the tools and practices of machine learning. These tools and practices of machine learning matter to the world. Four reasons that they matter are:

-  <u> **Automatically**</u>: Machine learning methods are **automated processes (algorithms) that create algorithms. The methods run on data and produce a model** that specifies how to achieve the programâ€™s goal.
-   <u>**Fast**</u>: Machine learning methods **save you time. The methods can analyze sample input data and deliver a program faster than you** could manually write one.
-   <u>**Accurate**</u>: Machine learning methods **can do a better job than you. As automated methods, they can run longer on more data than you in order to make more accurate decisions.**
-   <u>**Scale**</u>: Machine learning methods **can provide [[Complex problems|solutions to problems that you cannot solve.]] The methods can scale and be interconnected to achieve solutions to problems that previously could not be considered or even conceived.**
