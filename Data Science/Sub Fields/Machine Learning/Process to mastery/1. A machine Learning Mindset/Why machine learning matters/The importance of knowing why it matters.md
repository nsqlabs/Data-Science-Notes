It is important to know why machine learning matters so that you know the intrinsic value of the field and of methods and open questions in the field.
```

**Like knowing your why, knowing the value of the field can be used as a powerful filter of information and help you focus on those methods that actually deliver on the promise that the field makes.**

Machine learning **matters because it provides methods that can create solutions toÂ [complex problems](https://machinelearningmastery.com/practical-machine-learning-problems-real-world-examples-and-discover-how-to-identify-common-classes-of-machine-learning-problems/ "Practical Machine Learning Problems: Real-world Examples and Discover How to Identify Common Classes of Machine Learning Problems").** You will discover that there are [[Complex problems|problems for which it is not feasible to manually specify how a program solves a problem.]]

```ad-abstract
The promise that machine learning makes is that **it provides tools to generate a solution to complex problems, faster, more accurately and more scalable than we could program a solution manually.**
