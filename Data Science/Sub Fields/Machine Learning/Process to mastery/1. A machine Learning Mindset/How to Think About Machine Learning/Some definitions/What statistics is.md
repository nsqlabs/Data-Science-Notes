Statistics, or applied statistics with computers, is a sub-field of mathematics that is concerned with describing and understanding the relationships in data.

This could encompass diverse types of learning such as:

-   Developing models to summarize the distribution of a variable.
-   Developing models to best characterize the relationship between two variables.
-   Developing models to test the similarity between two populations of observations.

It also overlaps with the corner of [[What machine learning is|machine learning]] interested in learning patterns in data.

Many methods used for understanding data in statistics can be used in machine learning to learn patterns in data. These tasks could be called machine learning or applied statistics.
