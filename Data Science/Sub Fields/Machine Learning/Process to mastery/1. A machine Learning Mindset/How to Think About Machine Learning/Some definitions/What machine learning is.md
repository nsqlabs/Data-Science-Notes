Machine learning is a field of computer science concerned with programs that learn.

title: Definition of Machine learning - [Machine Learning (McGraw-Hill), 1997](https://amzn.to/2svq4dV).
*"The field of machine learning is concerned with the question of <mark style="background: gray; color: black; font-weight: 600">how to construct computer programs that automatically improve with experience.</mark> "*
```

That is super broad.

There are <u>many types of learning, many types of feedback to learn from, and many things that can be learned.</u>

This could encompass diverse types of learning, such as:

-   Developing code to investigate how populations of organisms “learn” to adapt to their environment over evolutionary time.
-   Developing code to investigate how one neuron in the brain “learns” in response to stimulus from other neurons.
-   Developing code to investigate how ants “learn” the optimal path from their home to their food source.

I give these esoteric examples on purpose to help you really nail down that machine learning is a broad and far reaching program of research.

Another case that you may be more familiar with is:

-   <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Developing code to investigate how to “learn” patterns in historical data.</mark> 

This is less glamorous, but is<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;"> the basis of the small corner of machine learning in which we as practitioners are deeply interested.</mark> 

This corner is not distinct from the other examples; there can be a lot of overlap in methods for learning, fundamental tasks, ways of evaluating learning, and so on.
