It overlaps with machine learning.

Artificial intelligence is also an area of computer science, but it is concerned with developing programs that are intelligent, or can do intelligent things.

Intelligence involves learning, e.g. machine learning, but may involve other concerns such as reasoning, planning, memory, and much more.

This could encompass diverse types of learning such as:

-   Developing code to investigate how to optimally plan logistics.
-   Developing code to investigate how to reason about a paragraph of text.
-   Developing code to investigate how to perceive the contents of a photograph.

**Artificial intelligence is often framed in the context of an agent in an environment with the intent to address some problem, but this does not have to be the case.**

Machine learning could just as easily be named artificial learning to remain consistent with artificial intelligence and help out beginners.

The lines are blurry. Machine learning problems are also artificial intelligence problems.
