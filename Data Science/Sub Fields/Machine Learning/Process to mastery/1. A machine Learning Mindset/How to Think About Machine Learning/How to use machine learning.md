Machine learning is a large field of study, and it can help you solve specific problems.

But you don’t need to know about all of it.

-   You’re not an academic investigating an esoteric type of learning as in machine learning.
-   You’re not trying to make an intelligent agent as in artificial intelligence.
-   You’re not interested in learning more about why variables relate to each other in data as in statistics.

In fact, **when it comes to learning relationships in data:**

-   **You’re not investigating the capabilities of an algorithm.**
-   **You’re not developing an entirely new theory or algorithm.**
-   **You’re not extending an existing machine learning algorithm to new cases.**

These may be activities in the corner of machine learning that we may be interested in, but activities for academics, not practitioners like you.

**So what parts of machine learning do you need to focus on?**

I think there are two ways to think about machine learning:

1.  [[The right way to state a ML problem|In terms of the problem you are trying to solve.]]
2.  [[The right way to state a ML Solution|In terms of the solution you require.]]
