**So what parts of machine learning do you need to focus on?**

I think there are two ways to think about machine learning:

1.  In terms of the problem you are trying to solve.
2.  In terms of the solution you require.

```ad-example
Your problem can best be described as the following:
Find a model or procedure that makes best use of historical data comprised of inputs and outputs in order to skillfully predict outputs given new and unseen inputs in the future
```

This is super specific.

1) First of all, **it discards entire sub-fields of machine learning, such as unsupervised learning, to focus on one type of learning called supervised learning and all the algorithms that fit into that bucket.**
	- That does not mean that you cannot leverage unsupervised methods; it just means that you do not focus your attention there, at least not to begin with.
2) Second of all, **it gives you a clear objective that dominates all others:** that is model skill at the expense of other concerns such as model complexity, model interpretability, and so on.
	- Again, this does not mean that these are not important, just that they are considered after or in conjunction with model skill.
3) Thirdly, **the framing of your problem this way fits neatly into another field of study called predictive modeling. That is a field of study that borrows methods from machine learning with the objective of developing models that make skillful predictions.**

In some areas of business, this area may also be called predictive analytics and encompasses more than just the modeling component to include related activities of gathering and preparing data and deploying and maintaining the model.

**More recently, this activity can also be called data science, although that phrase also has connotations of inventing or discovering the problem in addition to working it through to a solution.**

I don’t think it matters what you call this activity. But I do think **it is important to deeply understand that your interest in and use of machine learning is highly specific and different from some other uses by academics.**

It allows you to filter the material you read and the tools you choose in order to stay focused on the problem you’re trying to solve.
