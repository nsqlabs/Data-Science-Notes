Every machine learning algorithm has three components:

-   **Representation**: how to represent knowledge. Examples include decision trees, sets of rules, instances, graphical models, neural networks, support vector machines, model ensembles and others.
-   **Evaluation**: the way to evaluate candidate programs (hypotheses). Examples include accuracy, prediction and recall, squared error, likelihood, posterior probability, cost, margin, entropy k-L divergence and others.
-   **Optimization**: the way candidate programs are generated known as the search process. For example combinatorial optimization, convex optimization, constrained optimization
