1.  **Solving less complex problems.** Machine learning, specifically deep learning algorithms, are useful for finding complex relationships and hidden patterns in data consisting of many interdependent variables. For less complicated problems, if the rule-based system is giving performance comparable to a machine learning system, then it is advisable to avoid the use of a machine learning system.
2.  **Lack of labeled data and in-house expertise.** Most deep learning models require labeled data and an expert team to train the models and put them in production. It is advisable not to use deep learning algorithms to deliver projects if you don’t have enough labeled data and a dedicated team. For example, let’s say that you are developing a model that detects illegal listings from the e-commerce company website. The operation team has determined some keywords to help find illegal listings. Due to the mentioned constraints, you might go with a rule-based approach using keywords to detect illegal listings, and later, as the second version of the model, you can implement an image classification system along with some text models to detect illegal listings once required resources are acquired.
