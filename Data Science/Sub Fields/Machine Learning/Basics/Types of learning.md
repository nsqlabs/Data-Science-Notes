There are four types of machine learning:

-   **Supervised learning**: (also called inductive learning) Training data includes desired outputs.  This is spam this is not, learning is supervised.
-   **Unsupervised learning**: Training data does not include desired outputs. Example is clustering. It is hard to tell what is good learning and what is not.
-   **Semi-supervised learning**: Training data includes a few desired outputs.
-   **Reinforcement learning**: Rewards from a sequence of actions. AI types like it, it is the most ambitious type of learning.
