The `FROM` command is used to specify which table to select or delete data from.

The following SQL statement selects the "CustomerName" and "City" columns from the "Customers" table:

```SQL
SELECT CustomerName, City
FROM Customers;
```

The following SQL statement selects all the columns from the "Customers" table:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM Customers;```
