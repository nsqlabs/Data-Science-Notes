Beautifully visualized and effectively communicated trivia are a waste of your time. Exciting findings which turn out to be misinterpretations are a waste of your time. Meticulous forays into garbage data sources are a waste of your time. Irrelevant anecdotes are a waste of your time. Anything an analyst brings you that you don’t find worth your time… is a waste of your time.

Analysts _will_ waste your time — that’s part of exploration — so the analytics game is all about wasting as little of it as possible. In other words, optimizing **_inspiration-per-minute_** (of their time _and_ yours, subject to some exchange rate related to how valuable each of you is to your organization).

> Don’t be fooled by a simplistic interpretation of speed. A sloppy analyst who keeps falling for shiny nonsense “insights” will only slow everyone down in the long run.
