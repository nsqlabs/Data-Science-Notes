Analysts look up facts and produce inspiration for you, while trying to waste as little of their own time (and yours!) in the process. To get the best time-to-inspiration payoff, they must master many different forms of speed, including:

-   Speed of getting data that’s promising and relevant. (**_Domain knowledge._**)
-   Speed of getting data ready for manipulation. (**_Software skills._**)
-   Speed of getting data summarized. (**_Mathematical skills._**)
-   Speed of getting data summaries into their own brains. (**_Data visualization skills._**)
-   Speed of getting data summaries into stakeholders’ brains. (**_Communication skills._**)
-   Speed of getting the decision-maker inspired. (**_Business acumen._**)


```ad-warning
Beautifully visualized and effectively communicated trivia are a waste of your time. Exciting findings which turn out to be misinterpretations are a waste of your time. Meticulous forays into garbage data sources are a waste of your time. Irrelevant anecdotes are a waste of your time. Anything an analyst brings you that you don’t find worth your time… is a waste of your time.
