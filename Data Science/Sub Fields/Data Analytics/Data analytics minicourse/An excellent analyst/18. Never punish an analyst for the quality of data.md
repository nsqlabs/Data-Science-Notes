Decision-makers, think of your analyst as a new sensory organ you’ve just evolved: a new kind of eye that allows you to perceive information that you would otherwise have been blind to.

If you direct your new eyes at something that wasn’t worth seeing, you wouldn’t gouge them out for it, right?


> Analytics is the difference between seeing where you’re going and flying blind. Unless you’re covered in bubble-wrap and going nowhere, keen senses are worth investing in.

Similarly, if analysts find nothing valuable in a dataset you asked them to examine for you, don’t punish them. Keeping them around is an investment in being able to see in new ways. **If you don’t like what they’re looking at, direct them towards a scene with more potential.**
