Textbooks are a great analogy for datasets, so a couple of additional things to bear in mind about both datasets and textbooks are:

-   **One decision-maker’s garbage could be another’s treasure.** Like textbooks, datasets are only useful to you if they cover a topic you want to learn about.
-   **If it has a human author, it is subjective.** Like textbooks, datasets have human authors whose biases can rub off on the contents.
