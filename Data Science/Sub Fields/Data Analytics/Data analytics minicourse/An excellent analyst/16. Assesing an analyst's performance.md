For those who love performance assessments, be warned that you can’t use **_[[15. The importance of not wasting time|inspiration-per-minute]]_** to measure your analysts.

That’s because the maximum amount of inspiration (as defined subjectively by the [decision-maker](http://bit.ly/quaesita_di)) that can be extracted varies from [dataset to dataset](http://bit.ly/quaesita_provenance). But you could assess their _skills_ (not job performance) by letting them loose on a benchmark dataset whose contents you are already well-acquainted with.

```ad-example
As an analogy, if you ask two analysts to extract inspiration from a foreign language textbook, the better (faster) analyst for the job might be the native speaker of that language. You could assess their **_relative skill_** by measuring the speed with which they comprehend a passage you wrote in that language.
```

> ## Skill doesn’t guarantee impact. That’s up to your data.

But once you’ve assessed skills, remember that skill doesn’t guarantee impact. That’s up to your data. To go back to the earlier analogy, if you point both analysts at a mysterious textbook you’ve never opened, you can’t hold them accountable for **_inspiration-per-minute_** they find because the book might be filled with rubbish. If that’s the case — no matter their level of fluency! — neither one will find any inspiration to bring back to you… and that’s not their fault. Having a textbook doesn’t mean you’ll learn something useful. The same goes for datasets; their quality and relevance matters just as much.
