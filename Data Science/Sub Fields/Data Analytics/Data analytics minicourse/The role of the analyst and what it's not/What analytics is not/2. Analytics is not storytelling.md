## *Analysts can tell stories, but they’re not storytellers*
```

Contrary to popular belief, an analyst’s function is not to “tell stories” or to persuade with data. That’s called _marketing_. (Or perhaps _journalism_.)

There comes a time in every adult’s life where we have to market our work so that our stakeholders value us and do what we want them to, but let’s call that dark art what it is and talk about it in a different article. Sure, **good analysts know a lot about human attention and can manipulate their audience, but that’s a by-product of one career that opens doors to another**. Being able to tell stories is a skill analysts need to have, but their job is something else.
