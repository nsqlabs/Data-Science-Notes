```python
weight <- c(50, 946, 454, 454, 110, 100, 340, 454, 200, 148, 355, 907, 454, 822, 127, 750, 255, 500, 500, 500, 8, 125, 284, 118, 227, 148, 125)  
weight <- weight[order(weight, decreasing = TRUE)]  
print(weight)
```

The trouble with these 27 numbers is that even if they’re sorted, they don’t mean much to us. **<mark style="background: #FF5582A6; color: black">As we read them, we forget what we just read a second ago. That’s human brains for you; tell us to read a sorted list of a million numbers and at best we’ll remember the last few. We need a quick way to 
sort and summarize so we can get a handle on what we’re looking at.</mark> **

> `median(weight)`

Turns out the answer is `284g`. Who doesn’t love instant gratification? There are all kinds of summary options: _min(), max(), mean(), median(), mode(), variance()_… try them all! Or try this single magic word to find out what happens.

By the way, these things are called **_statistics_**. A statistic is any way of mushing up your data.
