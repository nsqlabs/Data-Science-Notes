As an analyst, **I’m not supposed to sell you anything. I’m here to be your eyes and get you as much inspiration per minute as possible.** T<mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">he reason you need an analyst in the first place is that you don’t have the time to go poking around in data, but you still want to be the one to call the shots.</mark> In this scenario, I may have _more_ domain expertise than you… but that doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll consent to my picking your costume for you. **You hired me to open your eyes, not to decide on your behalf. You don’t want to give up your power to choose and it’s my duty to respect that. _That_ is what separates analytics from decision-making and [[4. Analytics is not marketing|marketing]].**

title: Don't lose your mind
If a decision-maker doesn’t want to give up their power to choose, it’s an analyst’s duty to respect that. Even if the analyst knows the domain better than the decision-maker.

If I took the [[4. Analytics is not marketing|marketing]] or [[2. Analytics is not storytelling|storytelling]] approach, I’d be blinkering you and impoverishing your view of the possibility space. <mark style="background: green;">A good analyst does the opposite, **exposing you quickly to a rich variety of perspectives.** Ideally, I’ll help you absorb all the information you’d look for if you were the one taking the time to roam around in the data… plus useful things you didn’t even know you should ask to see.</mark>
