Domain expertise is extremely important for analysts — if I didn’t have it, I’d better scramble to get it. Analysts who’ve never even heard of Halloween will be severely hampered in their ability to help you pick a costume. They’ll probably snooze past all kinds of useful data because they won’t know what they’re looking at. 

```ad-hint
It’s a bad sign to see an analyst entering a new domain without immediately asking, _“Where can I find a domain guru to talk to?”_
