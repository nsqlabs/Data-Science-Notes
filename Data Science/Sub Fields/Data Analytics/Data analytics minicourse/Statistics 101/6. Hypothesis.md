title: What is an hypothesis?

Hypotheses are descriptions of what the world might look like.
```

- The **_null hypothesis_** describes **all worlds where doing the default action is a happy choice**.
- The **_alternative hypothesis_** is all other worlds. \

```ad-hint
If I convince you -with data!- that you don’t live in the null hypothesis world, then you had better change your mind and take the **alternative action**.
```

```ad-example

“We can walk to class together (_default action_) if you usually take under 15 minutes to get ready (_null hypothesis_), but if the evidence (_data_) suggests it’s longer (_alternative hypothesis_), you can walk by yourself because I’m outta here (_alternative action_).”
```
