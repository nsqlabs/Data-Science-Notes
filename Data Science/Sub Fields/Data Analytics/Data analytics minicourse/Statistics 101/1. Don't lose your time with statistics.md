```ad-question
What should you do if your mind isn’t set? What if you have no opinions whatsoever?
```

Just **go with your estimate** (that’s just a fancy way of saying **“best guess based on what you know”**). How do you get one? <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Just look at the data and report what’s there.</mark> This is called analytics (a.k.a. data-mining) and if you’ve ever used a spreadsheet, you’ve already done it.
The good news is that **your gut is actually pretty good at giving you the right estimate. No need for complex mathemagics.**

```ad-hint
title:“But it could be wrong!”
icon:exclamation
Of course it could be wrong, that’s what it means to be uncertain. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">There’s no mathemagic in the world that can make certainty out of uncertainty. Your best guess might be a mistake, but it is your _best_ guess, which makes any other guess a worse guess and even more likely to be wrong.</mark>
