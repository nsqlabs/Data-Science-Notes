Pause for a moment and imagine you’re choosing between blue and orange hats. **If you are truly indifferent between them and the data stack up in favor of orange, you’d be insane to end up with blue.** Even you only had 3 data points total. Even if it’s only 0.0000000000001% in favor of orange. By what madness did you get blue?! Go with orange, no math required.

> *If you’re indifferent between these hats to begin with and you get more votes for orange than blue, there’s no math in the world that should tell you to pick blue. Math isn’t magic and it doesn’t violate common sense.*

**The only way it makes sense to end up choosing blue is if you had a preference for the blue hat to begin with. Then you’re asking whether the evidence in favor of orange is strong enough. In other words, whether there’s enough data to change your mind.** Okay, so how can you tell? Welcome to statistics.

You can make your decision immediately. If your evidence is out of line with your preference, you can use statistical calculations to find out whether the evidence should make you want to change your mind.</mark> *
