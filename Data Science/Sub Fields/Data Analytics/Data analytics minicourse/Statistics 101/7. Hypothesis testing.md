title:Testing in a nutshell

“Does our evidence make the null hypothesis look ridiculous?”
```

All of **_hypothesis testing_** is all about asking: does our evidence make the null hypothesis look ridiculous?

- **_Rejecting the null hypothesis_** means we learned something and we should change our minds.
- Not rejecting the null means **_we learned nothing interesting_**, just like going for a hike in the woods and seeing no humans doesn’t prove that there are no humans on the planet. It just means we didn’t learn anything interesting about humans existing.

It shouldn’t, because you have a lovely insurance policy: you know exactly what action to take. If you learned nothing, you have no reason to change your mind, so keep doing the default action.
