There’s a variety of opinions, but the definition I favor is this one: “**Data science is the discipline of making data useful**.” Its three subfields involve:

- Mining large amounts of information for inspiration ([analytics](http://bit.ly/quaesita_analysts)).
- Making decisions wisely based on limited information ([statistics](http://bit.ly/quaesita_statistics)).
- Using patterns in data to automate tasks ([ML/AI](http://bit.ly/quaesita_emperor)).

```ad-hint
All of data science boils down to this: knowledge is power.
```

**The universe is full of information waiting to be harvested and put to good use. While our brains are amazing at navigating our realities, they’re not so good at storing and processing some types of very useful information.**
