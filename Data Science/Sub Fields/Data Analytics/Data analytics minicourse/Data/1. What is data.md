Everything our senses perceive is data, though its storage in our cranial wet stuff leaves something to be desired. Writing it down is a bit more reliable, especially when we write it down on a computer. When those notes are well-organized, we call them **_data_**... though I’ve seen some awfully messy electronic scribbles get the same name. I’m not sure why some people pronounce the word **_data_** like it has a capital D in it.
