If you close your eyes, do you remember every detail of what you just saw? No? Me neither. That’s pretty much the reason we collect data. **If we could remember and process it flawlessly in our heads, there’d be no need. The internet could be one hermit in a cave, recounting all the tweets of humankind and perfectly rendering each of our billions of cat photos.**

We take the memory revolution for granted since it started millenia ago with merchants needing a reliable record of who sold whom how many bushels of what. Take a moment to realize how glorious it is to have a universal system of writing that stores numbers better than our brains do. When we record data, we produce an unfaithful corruption of our richly perceived realities, but after that we can transfer uncorrupted copies of the result to other members of our species with perfect fidelity. Writing is amazing! Little bits of mind and memory that get to live outside our bodies.
