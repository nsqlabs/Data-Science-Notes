Everything we perceive is stored somewhere, at least temporarily. There’s nothing magical about data except that it’s written down more reliably than brains manage. Some information is useful, some is misleading, the rest is in the middle. The same goes for data.

We take our amazing biological capabilities for granted and exaggerate the difference between our innate information processing and the machine-assisted variety. The difference is durability, speed, and scale… but the same rules of common sense apply in both. Why do those rules go out the window at the first sign of an equation?

I’m glad we celebrate information as fuel for progress, but worshipping data as something mystical makes no sense to me. It’s better to speak about data simply, since we’re all data analysts and always have been. Let’s empower everyone to see themselves that way!
