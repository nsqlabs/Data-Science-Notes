Analytical thinking is totally different from critical thinking.

In critical thinking a decision is made regardless of the correctness or fallacy of the event, object, or situation. The data and information are evaluated then conclusions are made based on the unique perception of the information and data. Information and data are combined with current knowledge to make the accurate assessment. Basically information and data in critical thinking are used to create an opinion.

In Analytical thinking — as discussed above — is the breaking down of information and data into smaller pieces. Conclusion is made in a step by step process to solve the issue. Various points of view are evaluated with the aim to understand the cause and effect.[2]
