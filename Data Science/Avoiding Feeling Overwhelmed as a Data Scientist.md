# Start with a Question, then Seek for Resources to Answer your Question

Instead of taking courses on many subjects of data science, grasp the basics, then start tackling the projects. You might not have all of the steps at the top of your head to tackle your project. That is okay, in fact, that is expected.

By working on the real-world projects, you will start to ask realistic questions, such as

-   My data has a lot of features, should I keep all of these features or should I just pick the ones that are relevant?
-   My data has a lot of null values, is there an algorithm that I could use without processing the null values?
-   If I want to predict whether or not an email is a spam, where should I start? Which algorithm should I use?

Once you form these questions, you can start searching for the answers on Google. You would be amazed by how many useful resources out there such as blog posts, Youtube videos, books on the subject.

There is no one good resource. Just pick one or two then apply the knowledge you learn on your problem.

# Learn by Playing with the Basics

Once you have found some potential resources, how do you go about reading the articles or documentation without being confused?

There might be a lot of content that targets for both beginners and advanced users in some documentation or blogs. Sometimes it provides more than what you actually need.

So if you have just learned a new tool, try to find a tutorial that explains the basics. Either an article that introduces to the tool or a getting started section in the documentation will work.

Once you have a basic understanding of what the tool does and how to use it, you can build up another layer of understanding by digging deeper into the documentation.

You will feel rewarded to see your problem is solved with the new knowledge you have just learned!

# Save the Useful Article for Later

Articles are great ways to learn different concepts and tools of data science. But you can also easily get lost with the new number of articles every day.

Instead of reading many articles then forgetting about them. **Read a few and actually apply them**. Try out the concepts or tools introduced in the article that could be beneficial for your current project.

But what if you read the articles that could be used for future reference? I used to use Instapaper to organize my articles but my articles got lost when the number of articles I save gets bigger. I realize that I rarely went back to the articles that I saved.

# Nail the fundamentals, build a portfolio quickly

It’s tempting to get carried away learning topics that are considered sexy, like machine learning, neural networks, and image recognition. However, most data science work does not involve complex systems like these. 

As a working data scientist, 90% of your work will be data cleaning.

To accelerate your learning, it’s better to master the simple stuff first rather than spending your time dabbling on advanced topics.

You should be spending your time with linear regression, k-means clustering, and logistic regression. Understand them (inside and out) so that you can flawlessly explain and interpret results. Then use what you know to complete projects and build a strong portfolio. 

A strong portfolio of completed projects is what makes you desirable to employers.

This is precisely why I created Dataquest the way I did. Knowing how valuable projects are to becoming a data scientist, virtually every course we build has a hands-on project for you to complete.

# Learn to communicate insights

Data scientists constantly need to present the results of their analysis to others. Doing this well can be the difference between being a mediocre data scientist and a great one. 

Yes, it really is that important.

A data scientist is only valuable when you’re able to convince others to act on what you found. Meaning, you need to learn how to be a great communicator.

**There are 3 parts to communicating your insights:**

1.  Understand the topic and theory. You’ll never be able to explain something that you don’t understand yourself. 
2.  Know how to clearly organize your results. 
3.  Know how to explain your analysis clearly.

**It can be difficult to communicate complex concepts effectively, but here are some things to try:**

-   Start a blog. Post the results of your data analysis. Or submit a pitch and [write for Dataquest’s blog!](https://community.dataquest.io/t/why-and-how-you-can-write-in-dataquest-direct-to-boost-your-career/522437)
    
-   Try to teach your less tech-savvy friends and family about computer science concepts. It’s amazing how much teaching can help you understand concepts.
    
-   Try to speak at meetups.
    
-   Use GitHub to host and share your analysis.
    
-   Get active on communities like [Quora](https://www.quora.com/), [Dataquest learning community](https://community.dataquest.io/), or [machine learning subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/machinelearning).

# Constantly increase the degree of difficulty

When was the last time a project you were working on challenged you or stretched your capabilities?

Data science is a steep mountain to climb. But if you stop climbing, you’ll never make it to the top!

The data science field is vast. You’ll never have an in-depth understanding of everything. But, the more you can learn, the more experienced and valuable you will be to the teams you work with. 

**If you’re starting to get too comfortable, here are some ideas that can get you outside of your comfort zone and help you level-up your skill set:**

-   Take more advanced data science courses ([Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/data-science-courses/) has these)
    
-   Work with a larger data set. Learn to use Spark.
    
-   See if you can make your algorithm faster.
    
-   How would you scale your algorithm to multiple processors? Can you do it?
    
-   Understand the theory of the algorithm you’re using better. Does this change your assumptions?
    
-   Try to teach a novice to do the same things you’re doing now.
    

That last one is a really underrated challenge, and if you give it a try, you’ll quickly see how valuable teaching can be to someone who’s trying to learn. 

You’ll likely come out of the experience with a much deeper understanding of the topic than you had before, and you will improve your communication and explanation skills too.
