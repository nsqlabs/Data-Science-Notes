Let’s take an example to better understand this. Imagine you’ve been given a dataset on house prices and you need to predict the value of future real estate. There are over 200 variables, including number of buildings, rooms, number of tenants, family size, size of the courtyard, whether faucets are available, etc. There’s a good chance you might not be aware of what some variables mean. You can still build a model with a good accuracy, but you have no idea why a certain variable was dropped. As it turns out, that variable was a crucial element in a real-world scenario. It’s a calamitous mistake. Having knowledge of tools and libraries is a very good thing but combining that knowledge with the business problem posed by the domain is where a true data scientist steps in.

## How to avoid this mistake?

When you are applying for a data scientist role in a particular industry:

- Read up on how companies in that domain are using data science.
- Search for data sets and problems relating to that industry.
- Try solving these problems.

This will give you a massive boost.
