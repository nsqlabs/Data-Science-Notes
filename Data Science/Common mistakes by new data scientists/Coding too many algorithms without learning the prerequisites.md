Straightforward diving into the deep areas of data science is a common practice majority of aspiring data scientists make, resulting in **lack of knowledge about basic stuff and ultimately you will face problem in solving practical problems. If you do code an algorithm from scratch, do so with the intention of learning instead of perfecting your implementation.** At the start, you really don’t need to code every algorithm from scratch.

## How to avoid this mistake?

You need to clear four basic concepts before diving deep and these four concepts are Linear Algebra, Statistics, Probability and Calculus. Data science is sum of all individual parts. Till the time you don’t have a clear picture about these four concepts, don’t even think of diving deep into the core of data science. Though you can find tons of courses to learn these concepts online, below are some of the resources I have listed you can take help from:
