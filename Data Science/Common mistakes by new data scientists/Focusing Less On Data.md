This can be said as one of the major issues faced by an amateur data scientist of which they are unaware most of the time. Since you have started your career as a data scientist, you have grasped all the fancy algorithms of machine learning as well as deep learning. One thing to keep in mind that data plays a very crucial role and ignoring it will just be doing “Garbage in-Garbage out”.

Also, after you have done analysing the data, runs the algorithm and got fair metrics, you think that the work is accomplished. That is where you ignored all the possible risks that may b seen in the future. Your eagerness for completing the task may lead you to risks such as data leakage, overfitting, and other biases.

## **How To Avoid Them**

When building a model, most of the work is done at the data and features level. It is better to concentrate a little more on data than on the algorithm because your data and its features will shape your model at the last. The quality of your final model will completely depend on the data than the algorithm.
