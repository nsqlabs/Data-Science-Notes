This mistake may cost you a little more. Most of the time, budding data scientists forget that a simple [machine learning](https://analyticsindiamag.com/machine-learning-jobs-across-india-via-analytics-india-jobs/) model with good data can beat the complex algorithms in a model. It is not always needed to use fancy complex algorithms to build a robust model.

The junior data scientist often gets lured by the fancy algorithms of deep learning and start thinking that everything can be solved using those algorithms with a little knowledge of exploring data and thus failed to meet the goal in the long run.

## **How To Avoid Them**

Techniques like logistics regression, linear regression, etc. can sometimes outperform complex algorithms. Firstly, you should think what your main purpose is and then start with building a simple model with a less fancy algorithm. It is better not to make it complex which is already complex.
