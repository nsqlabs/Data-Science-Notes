Data is key to any data science and machine learning task. Data comes in different flavors such as numerical data, categorical data, text data, image data, voice data, and video data. **_The predictive power of a model depends on the quality of data used in building the model_**. It is therefore extremely important that before performing any data science task such as exploratory data analysis or building a model, you check the source and reliability of your data because even datasets that appear perfect may contain errors. There are several factors that could diminish the quality of your data:

-   Wrong Data
-   Missing Data
-   Outliers in Data
-   Redundancy in Data
-   Unbalanced Data
-   Lack of Variability in Data
-   Dynamic Data
-   Size of Data

From my personal experience working on an industrial data science project, my team had to work with system engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, field engineers, and technicians over a period of 3 months just to understand the available dataset and how we could use it to frame the right questions to be answered using the data. Ensuring that your data is error-free and of high quality will help improve the accuracy and reliability of your model.
