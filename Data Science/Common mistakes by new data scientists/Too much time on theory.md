Many beginners fall into the trap of spending too much time on theory, whether it be math related (linear algebra, statistics, etc.) or machine learning related (algorithms, derivations, etc.). It is good to get a grasp of the theory behind machine learning techniques. But if you don’t apply them, they are only theoretical concepts. When someone starts learning they study lots of books and go through a number of online courses but they rarely get the chance of applying theory into solving practical problems.

In the beginning whenever ,I faced a problem and had the chance to apply what I have learnt, I couldn’t remember the half of it. This was all because of giving so much time to theory and very less time to solving practical problems.

## How to avoid this mistake?

It is not a new concept that to get better understanding of what you are learning, there should be a proper balance between theory and practical. Google is the best place to find different datasets for practice. Below are some of the data problems you can practice (ordered from easiest to hardest):
