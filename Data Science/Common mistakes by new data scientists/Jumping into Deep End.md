As they say, “Rome wasn’t build in a day.” The same goes for data science too. I understand that you want to build the technology of future , self driving cars, robots and what not! Things like this require techniques such as deep learning and natural language processing. Before going into this typical stuff you must first master the fundamental of machine learning etc.

#### How to avoid this mistake?

First, master the techniques and algorithms of “classical” machine learning, which serve as building blocks for advanced topics. It is a common practice that people just practice 2–3 problems and after solving them they begin to think that they have mastered the concepts but this isn’t true. The more you practice the more groomed you become. Below I am inserting a link where you can find some quality 20 machine learning problems, on which you can try your hands on. You can find a tons of problems like this, just give a search on Google.
