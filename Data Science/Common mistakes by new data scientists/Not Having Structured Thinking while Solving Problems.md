Structured thinking is a process of putting a framework to an unstructured problem. Having a structure not only helps an analyst understand the problem at a macro level, it also helps by identifying areas which require deeper understanding. Without structure, an analyst is like a tourist with out a map. He might understand where he wants to go, but he doesn’t know how to get there. He would not be able to judge which tools and vehicles he would need to reach the desired place. When you are going for a data science interview, you will inevitably be given a case study, prediction problem etc. Because of the pressure filled atmosphere in an interview room and the time constraint, the interviewer looks at how well you structure your thoughts to arrive at a final result. This can be a deal breaker or deal sealer for getting the job.
