Correlation does not imply causation. Correlation is a statistical technique that refers to how two variables change together (ex: if there is a change in variable x then there will be the change in y). When x increases, y increases, which means that x and y are correlated.

But, it doesn’t always mean that x causes y or y causes x. Sometimes, illogical analysis says x causes y because x and y are correlated, but this isn’t always true.

Let’s look at an example:

_After launching a new feature in an app, the customer retention of the app increases. New features and customer retention might be correlated, but that doesn’t mean that the new feature caused customer retention. There might be many other factors for customer retention but both results are related._

Don’t jump to the conclusion of causation too quickly after finding correlation.
