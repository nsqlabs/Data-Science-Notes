The benefits of continuous learning and growth at a personal and professional level mean you will continue to place a strong importance on learning new skills and sharing your knowledge base which will assist in all areas of life, from creating more meaningful relationships, to better organisation and time management skills. **Remember that practicing for 2 hours daily is much better than practicing for 14 hours on weekends.** We study for a period of time, then we give it a break for the next 2 months. Trying to get back into the groove of things after that is a nightmare. Most of the earlier concepts are forgotten, notes are lost and it feels like we just wasted the last few months.

#### How to avoid this mistake?

**Plan how and what you want to study and set deadlines for yourself.**

1. Set a plan.
2. Give yourself a set number of days/weeks to learn that topic and then practice it by competing in hackathons/workshops etc. You have decided to become a data scientist so you should be ready to put in the hours.
3. If you continually keep finding excuses not to study, this might not be the field for you.
4. If you practice continuously it will give you a clarity in decision making, gives you control over future and a sense of personal satisfaction.
