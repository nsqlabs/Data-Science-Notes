In data science, there’s a famous saying: Your results are only as good as your data. Unfortunately, we don’t often don’t have a say in how or where the data is collected. That’s why, when we set up steps to solve a problem using a data set, we need to consider whether there’s inherent [bias](https://builtin.com/data-science/bias-variance-tradeoff) present in the data or whether it’s a good representation of the entire population. Doing so helps us avoid ending up with [skewed](https://builtin.com/data-science/skewed-data) models.
