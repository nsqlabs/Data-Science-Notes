There might be multiple datasets to a problem and a good data scientist needs to consider all different datasets and try to link the information between them. Sometimes information is divided among various datasets to make it more readable. It’s a data scientist’s job to create a link, understand, and draw a correct picture of the data set while building the model.

Let’s look at an example:

_Generally, in time series analysis, we have yearly or monthly datasets. Machine learning models need to learn from all datasets for accurate predictive modeling. Similarly, there are datasets with lots of text data in one dataset and other features related to the text in other datasets. Consolidating these datasets to gain a correct understanding of the data is important._

Never neglect or ignore any information. In the case of the small dataset, upsampling and augmentation work well to increase the size of the dataset. On bigger datasets, machine learning models and [deep learning models](https://smartboost.com/blog/deep-learning-vs-neural-network/) work very well.
