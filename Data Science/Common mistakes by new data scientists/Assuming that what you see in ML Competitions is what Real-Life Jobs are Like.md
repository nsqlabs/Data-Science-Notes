This is one of the biggest misconceptions aspiring data scientists have these days. Competitions and hackathons provide us with datasets that are clean and spotless (okay – I went a little overboard, but you get the hang of it). You download them, and start working on the problem. Even those datasets that have columns with missing values don’t require you to work your brain cells off – figure out an imputation technique and fill in the blanks.

Unfortunately, real-world projects don’t work like that. There is an end-to-end pipeline which involves working with a bunch of people. You will almost always have to work with messy and unclean data. The old saying about spending 70-80% of your time just collecting and cleaning data is true. It’s the grueling part and you will (most likely) not enjoy but it’s something that eventually becomes part of a routine.

Also, and we will cover this in more detail in the next point, the simpler model will win precedence over any complex stacked ensemble model. Accuracy isn’t always the end goal, and this is one of the most contrasting things you’ll learn on the job.

## How can you avoid this mistake?

One of the key factors to negate this misunderstanding is, ironically, experience. The more experience you gain (internships help a lot in this case), the better you’ll be able to distinguish between the two. This is where social media comes in handy – reach out to data scientists and ask them their experience.

Additionally, I suggest going through **[this Quora thread](https://www.quora.com/How-similar-are-Kaggle-competitions-to-what-data-scientists-do)** where data scientists from around the world provide their input on this exact question. Getting a good score on a competition leaderboard is excellent for measuring your learning progress, but interviewers will want to know how you can optimize your algorithm for impact, not for the sake of increasing accuracy. Learn about how a data science project works, what different types of roles a team has (from a data engineer to a data architect), and structure your answer in that sense.
