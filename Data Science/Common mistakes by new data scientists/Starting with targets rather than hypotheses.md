It’s tempting to look for a data model that can offer specific improvements, like getting 80 percent of customer support cases closed in 48 hours or winning 10 percent more business in a quarter, but those metrics aren’t enough to work from.

“It’s better to start with a hypothesis when you can,” says Ortiz. “Often there’s a curve or a line you’re looking at as an overall metric and you want to move that; that can be a great business goal but it’s hard to imagine what levers you need to pull to do that.” Test your hypothesis about what will improve things, either with a control group or by exploring the data. “If you can run a test where you have a split test with a control group and both are representative samples, you can actually ascertain whether the method you’re using actually impacted what you wanted it to impact. If you’re just looking at data after the fact, beginning with the hypothesis can help narrow the scope. I need to increase this metric by 10 percent: What are my hypotheses for what might impact that and [then I can] do exploratory data analysis tracking just those in the data. Getting crystal clear on the question you’re asking and the hypothesis you’re testing can help reduce the amount of time you spend on it.”
