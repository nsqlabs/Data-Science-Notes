Its important to compare the predictive power of several different algorithms before selecting your final model. For example, if you are building a **_classification model_**, you may try the following algorithms:

-   Logistic Regression classifier
-   Support Vector Machines (SVM)
-   Decision tree classifier
-   K-nearest neighbor classifier
-   Naive Bayes classifier

If you are building a **_linear regression model_**, you may compare the following algorithms:

-   Linear regression
-   K-neighbors regression (KNR)
-   Support Vector Regression (SVR)
