> Complacency Kills

Every soldier knows this, and every DS should, too. Being complacent about your data skills and not putting in the time to learn new ones is a common mistake. Doing this in the data field is more dangerous than in some other areas because data science is a field that’s relatively new and is still experiencing drastic changes and developments. There are constantly new algorithms, new tools, and even new programming languages being introduced.

If you don’t want to be that one data scientist who still only knows how to use STATA in 2021 (he exists, I worked with him), then you need to keep up with the developments in the field.



## **How to avoid this:**

-   Sign up for online classes to learn about new concepts and algorithms or to brush up on the ones you already know but haven’t used in a while on the job. The ability to learn is a muscle everyone should keep practicing, and being a life-long learner is probably the best gift you can give to yourself.
-   Sign up for a DS newsletter or follow a DS blogger/publication on Medium and develop a habit of following the DS “news.”
