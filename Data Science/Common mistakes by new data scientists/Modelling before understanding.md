Every budding data scientist should take a good hard look at the Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining, or the CRISP-DM[[2]](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-most-common-mistakes-made-by-aspiring-data-scientists#YLlmN). It’s a horrible acronym, but there’s a reason for why this has been the industry standard for two decades. A data science project starts with business understanding, data understanding and data preparation. This is really important. An inexperienced data scientist may be tempted to jump straight to modeling, but that will only backfire.
