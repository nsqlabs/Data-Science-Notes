Data visualization is such a wonderful facet of data science, yet a lot of aspiring data scientists prefer to skim over it and get to the model building stage. This approach might work out in competitions, but is bound to fail in a real job. Understanding the data you’re given is the single most important thing you will do, and your model’s results will reflect that.

By spending time on getting to know the dataset and trying out different charts, you will gain a deeper knowledge of the challenge or problem you’ve been tasked with solving. You’d be surprised to know how much insight you can gain just by doing this! Pattern and trends emerge, stories are told and the best part? Visualizations are the best way to present your findings to the client.

As a data scientist, you need to be inherently curious. It’s one of the great things about data science – the more curious you are, the more questions you’ll ask. This leads to a much better understanding of the data you are given and also helps solve problems you didn’t know existed in the first place!

## How can you avoid this mistake?

Practice! Next time you work on a dataset, spend more time on this step. You will be stunned at the amount of insight it will generate for you. Ask questions! Ask your manager, ask domain experts, search for solutions on the internet and if you don’t find any, ask on social media. So many options!
