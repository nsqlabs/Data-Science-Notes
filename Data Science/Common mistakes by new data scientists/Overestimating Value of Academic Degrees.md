Ever since data science became ultra popular, certifications and degrees have cropped up just about everywhere. **A strong degree in a related field can definitely boost your chances but it’s neither sufficient nor is it usually the most important factor.** I am not saying that getting a degree or certification is an easy feat but <mark style="background: green">one should not solely rely on them. In most cases, what’s taught in an academic setting is simply too different from the machine learning applied in businesses. While working in a real environment you have to cope up with lots of deadlines, technical roadblocks, clients etc , these are just some of the things you will need to overcome to become a good data scientist.</mark> Just a certification or degree will not qualify you for it.

#### How to avoid this mistake?

Certifications are valuable, but only when you apply that knowledge outside the classroom and put it out in the open.

- Take relevant internships, even if they are part-time.
- Reach out to local data scientists on LinkedIn for coffee chats.
- Always be open for learning.
- Go out in the real world and try to learn how the industry works.
