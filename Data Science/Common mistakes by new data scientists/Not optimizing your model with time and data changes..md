To become a better data scientist, optimizing your model is a must. You won’t get good results with a single go because the model needs to be optimized with time and data changes. 

Optimization is at the heart of every machine learning model. Setting optimized values to hyperparameters gives peak performance, which is why you should revisit and optimize your model from time to time based on new data. This data could include customer behavior changes, trends, seasonality, and more. Data science is a cycle of training, evaluating, optimizing, and re-training.

Let’s look at a simple example in our daily lives:

_You have a fixed route to get home from the office every day. Your fixed route has a stadium in-between. Switching to a new route to get home on a game day will save you time. This new route is an optimization that you made._
