Everyone has their own skills and everyone has their special talents. Gone are the days where coding used to a compulsory part of data analysis. **Now, you don’t have to put hours trying to learn code. I would say if you learn coding , it will obviously be a star on your skills. On the other hand if you are facing any difficulties with the coding part, there are nowadays a number of Exploratory Analysis tools available in the market to perform data analysis.** If you don’t code well, these tools I have mentioned below doesn’t require you to code explicitly but simple drag & drop clicks does the job. (all of these are free to download)
