Analysis needs a direction and plan to proceed. Data science problems begin with a well-defined objective. Sometimes, data scientists jump directly into analysis and modeling without thinking about the question they’re trying to answer first.

For data scientists, the question they are trying to answer isn’t “what” but “why.” To answer “why” questions, data scientists need to be clear on what they want to achieve with their analysis.

Here’s an example:

_As a data scientist, you need to know if the given problem is a supervised or unsupervised ML problem because further analysis and planning are done accordingly. Analyzing without knowing the type of problem first will lead nowhere._

Data scientists who don’t know what they actually want end up with analysis results that they don’t want. Always be ready with well-defined questions to hit your data science goal.
